        "longSummary": "When you think about it, you'll realize that project management is a bit of a misnomer. You're not actually managing a project, but rather the people completing it. This might be why project management is such a challenging discipline to learn. People are not technology. People have habits that need breaking and attitudes that need adjusting, but if you look at it that way, you will surely make them less inclined to engage with the work in a constructive way. Managing people is always best done as a pull rather than push strategy, because people don’t like being pushed. Pushing just makes them slam on the mental brakes. They want to think that everything they do is in some way their idea, which is when they do their best work, by the way. That is the biggest challenge for the project manager – to engage people in ways that help them experience satisfaction and inspiration in their work. The work they produce under these conditions will speak for itself.",

        "longSummary": "You can't learn to play the piano by reading a book about playing piano. Some skills require you to build muscle memory over time by doing. Anything that involves managing working relationships, negotiation, or communication fall under this definition. These are considered “soft” skills and aren’t learned in a traditional classroom. Colleges and universities are aware of this challenge. They incorporate soft skills material into instruction and exercises, but formal learning institutions are also under pressure to deliver as much technical learning as possible within a short window, so soft skills inevitably play second fiddle.

        "longSummary": "When a B2B client hires you to complete a project, you become an arm of that client’s organization for the time it takes to complete the work, which makes you different from virtually any other service provider. Your ability to craft a satisfactory daily experience for that client determines your future business with that client, and perhaps with many others in their close-knit business community. That means: more than any other professionals in the marketplace, you have to be switched on at all times. More than any web site, advertising, sales strategy, or marketing approach, this is what separates you from your competition.

        "longSummary": "Not all services organizations have dedicated proposal management personnel, but they can all adopt at least a few best practices. A proposal is a project in itself, which is why it needs a “project manager.” To distinguish the role in a technical services organization, however, we must call this person the “proposal manager.” A shortage of training opportunities for proposal managers in technical services makes this topic an essential element of Twennie’s library.

        "longSummary": "Your firm will not be credible with a client unless you’re able to show them that you were paying attention when they explained the project. That sounds simple, but you’d be surprised how many clients get proposals with pages and pages of vaguely relevant projects that never mention the project in question, or even the client hiring them to do it.

        "longSummary": "Storytelling charts a logical course inside a client's mind and gives form to their vision for successful project completion. Business storytelling builds a deeper connection based on emotional drivers of decisions and helps evaluators relate more intimately to the experience.

        "longSummary": "Social media posts and ads can so easily blend into the noise, especially if they’re too generic.

        "longSummary": "Personality profiling tells you what you will probably do based on past choices and habits. In reality, the very belief that your personality decides everything you do enslaves you to it. It becomes the perfect excuse not to do the work of evolving. No person has to live with ineffective behaviors because of some arbitrary assessment, whether it involves letters, numbers, colors or humors. Everyone has the power to choose new behaviors.

For instance, companies often find that 80% of their profits come from 20% of their customers, or that 80% of their sales are generated by 20% of their products. This insight helps organizations prioritize their resources and efforts.",
        "longSummary": "The Pareto principle's relevance extends beyond business into personal life and task management. Working people often discover that 20% of their activities produce 80% of their satisfaction or success, while 80% of their stress might come from 20% of their problems. This understanding can help individuals make better decisions about how to allocate their time and energy, focusing on high-impact activities and relationships while minimizing involvement in less productive areas. However, it's important to note that these percentages are approximate and illustrative rather than exact mathematical relationships.",

        "longSummary": "Implementing a people-before-profit philosophy requires careful balance and long-term thinking. While it may sometimes mean sacrificing short-term gains for long-term value, successful companies find ways to align people-centric practices with business sustainability. This might include investing in employee wellness programs that reduce healthcare costs and improve productivity or developing strong relationships with suppliers and communities that lead to more stable business operations.

The emphasis on billable hours, utilization rates, and project deadlines can create an environment where consultants feel unable to take necessary breaks or seek support when struggling.

        "longSummary": "The impact of workplace culture on organizational success cannot be overstated. Nurturing and people-focused cultures typically lead to higher employee engagement, reduced turnover, increased innovation, and better business outcomes. They create environments where employees feel psychologically safe to share ideas, take calculated risks, and raise concerns without fear of retribution. Conversely, toxic cultures characterized by poor communication, lack of trust, or misaligned incentives can undermine even the most well-planned business strategies, leading to decreased productivity, increased turnover, and damage to the organization's reputation.",

  "longSummary": "Clients begin shaping their projects long before the RFP is posted—sometimes months or even years in advance. By the time the proposal is invited, they’ve gone through months of internal planning, refinement, and emotional investment. This topic challenges reactive habits and introduces a proactive model built around lead awareness, cultural shifts, and the creation of a lead-generating engine. It helps technical professionals shift their pursuit efforts earlier in the client’s timeline—where influence is possible—and shows how to build consistent, measurable processes for identifying and tracking pre-RFP opportunities across an organization.",

This topic introduces client feedback software platforms such as Delighted, AskNicely, Simplesat, and others, highlighting how they support structured, consistent, and scalable feedback processes.
