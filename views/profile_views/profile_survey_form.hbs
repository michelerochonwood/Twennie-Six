      <label>I see value in:</label>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="profileTypes" value="individual"> Individual Profiles</label>
      <p>An individual profile will give you something you can share with coworkers and other people in your professional network. If you're looking for work, a profile would allow you to showcase some of your work. Writing articles or filming videos could appear in that profile, giving a potential employer access to your portfolio.</p>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="profileTypes" value="group">Group Profiles</label>
      <p>A group profile allows you to post learning initiatives and studies you have underway. This can be valuable to leaders and their groups when they want their team to stand out in their organization as forward-thinking and growth-minded.</p>
      <label><input type="checkbox" name="profileTypes" value="organization"> Organizational Profiles</label>
      <p>An organizational profile would allow your team to compete in learning challenges with other teams from other organizations. Twennie has some exciting cross-organizational competitions in the works for next year. If you're interested, check this box.</p>
