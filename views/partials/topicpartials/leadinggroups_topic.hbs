    <h3>Set Up the Group With Purpose</h3>
    <p>Begin by defining why the group exists and what “good” looks like in 30–60 days. Create your group, invite members, and set a simple cadence (weekly or bi-weekly). Choose a short list of units—articles, videos, exercises—that map to current project needs. State expectations clearly: time commitment (20-minute bursts), where notes live, and how you’ll close each micro-sprint (a brief debrief plus next steps). This upfront clarity reduces friction and makes every touchpoint feel consequential.</p>

    <h3>Assign Work and Keep Momentum</h3>
    <p>Use tags to assign units to specific people and roles. Keep due windows short to increase completion rates. The dashboards do the heavy lifting: members see “my tagged units,” leaders see “units tagged by my leader,” and everyone can spot “completed leader-assigned units.” Run lightweight check-ins to unblock progress and celebrate micro-wins—badges and completions matter. Mix formats (prompt sets, exercises, short videos) so learning stays practical and close to real work.</p>

    <h3>Facilitate, Capture, and Iterate</h3>
    <p>Lead like a facilitator, not a lecturer. Keep sessions focused, fast, and action-oriented. Capture decisions, examples, and next assignments directly in Twennie so lessons compound. Close each cycle with a 5-minute “what changed?” review: which habits improved, which KPIs moved (quality, schedule reliability, client feedback), and what the next micro-sprint will target. Over time, your group becomes a steady engine for better delivery and stronger proposals.</p>
