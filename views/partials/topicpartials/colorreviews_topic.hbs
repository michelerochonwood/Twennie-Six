    <h3>Blue &amp; Pink: Strategy and Story</h3>
    <p>Blue tests win themes with impartial reviewers who weren’t in the strategy session. Do the differentiators land? Would this truly win against competitors? Pink strengthens storyboards before drafting—flow, headlines, proof gaps, emphasis. Send reviewer packages 24+ hours ahead, keep sessions to 45–60 minutes, and capture clear actions. These early reviews prevent late thrash and make later edits smaller and smarter.</p>

    <h3>Red: Final Competitive Pass</h3>
    <p>Red reviews the complete draft against the client’s evaluation criteria. Recruit impartial reviewers well in advance, choose a collaborative medium (large printouts or an online board), and guide the discussion with targeted questions. Prioritize issues that affect scoring and compliance. Collect feedback, implement quickly, and close the loop with reviewers so they see their input reflected in the final.</p>

    <h3>Gold: Executive Risk/Commercial Check</h3>
    <p>Use Gold when fee or scope raises exposure. Keep the room small and authoritative: executive sponsor, Finance, Legal/Risk, and Operations. Confirm terms and exceptions, price and margin, work breakdown, and key assumptions. Outcome should be unambiguous: approve, approve with conditions, or stop. Schedule early, deliver concise decision briefs, and respect time—Gold is about readiness to sign, not editing prose.</p>
