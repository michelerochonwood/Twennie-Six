    <h3>Map a Right-Sized Path</h3>
    <p>Design a calm, repeatable process from capture to submission: Go/No-Go → Strategy (Blue) → Storyboarding (Pink) → Drafting → Finalization (Red) → Executive Check (Gold, if risk warrants) → Submit. Define roles early (capture lead, writer, reviewers, production) and set review gates with dates. Keep a living compliance matrix from day one. Time-box tasks into short, accountable blocks to prevent pile-ups in the last 48 hours.</p>

    <h3>Build the Story Before You Write</h3>
    <p>Lock the narrative with storyboards before heavy drafting. Clarify headlines, evidence, differentiators, and visuals per section. Integrate price and key assumptions into the storyline so value is explicit—not an appendix surprise. Draft to the storyboard to avoid rework, and maintain a running list of proof points (metrics, case studies, team credentials) so writers can drop in credible specifics fast.</p>

  <div class="subs-item">
    <h3>Protect Quality, Schedule, and Risk</h3>
    <p>Thread quality loops through the schedule: quick proof passes, graphics checks, and compliance sweeps at each gate. Track assumptions, exceptions, and risks as you go; don’t wait for the end. Use Blue/Pink/Red reviews to strengthen strategy, story, and the final draft. Run a Gold review only when fee/scope elevate exposure—confirm terms, exceptions, price/margin, and readiness to sign. Finish with a production checklist and a submission rehearsal.</p>
