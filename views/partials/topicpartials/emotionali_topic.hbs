    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence(EI)?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability of a person to recognize how their emotions shape behavior, how to manage those emotions, and how to recognize and empathize with the emotions of others. In technical consulting teams, emotional intelligence of team members is a major factor in successful project completion, which is why it belongs in the Twennie library.</p>

    <h3>The Personality Trap</h3>
    <p>Personality profiles can offer helpful insights. They highlight patterns in how we tend to think, act, and respond. But those patterns don’t define us. The idea that personality determines behavior can become limiting, especially if we start to believe we can’t change. In truth, everyone has the capacity to grow, adapt, and develop new ways of interacting with the world. That’s the essence of emotional intelligence: recognizing patterns, then choosing how to respond. Twennie encourages this kind of growth by exploring strategies that help professionals move beyond labels and into conscious, effective action.

    <h3>Learning EI</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence develops over a lifetime, but many of its foundations are laid early, often in childhood. That’s why making meaningful shifts in how we navigate our emotional lives as adults can feel especially challenging. It asks us to reexamine long-held beliefs and habits. But change is possible, and even small shifts can lead to more thoughtful, resilient ways of interacting with others. Twennie’s goal is to explore practical strategies for strengthening emotional intelligence, helping professionals build deeper self-awareness and more effective relationships over time.</p>
