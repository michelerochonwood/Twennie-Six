    <h3>Attract, Don’t Chase</h3>
    <p>Most technical firms spend their marketing energy chasing opportunities—writing proposals, responding to RFPs, or cold-emailing contacts. Pull marketing flips that approach. Instead of pursuing prospects, you make your brand magnetic. You create things—events, content, stories, experiences—that naturally draw the right people in. Done well, pull marketing generates interest long before the procurement cycle begins. It invites clients into your world, lets them get a feel for how you think and work, and builds trust without the hard sell.</p>

    <h3>Make Curiosity Your Advantage</h3>
    <p>Pull marketing works best when it sparks curiosity. The goal isn't to explain everything—it's to make people want to know more. In technical services, that might mean sharing unexpected lessons from the field, inviting the public to a project tour, or publishing behind-the-scenes visuals that show how your team collaborates. These aren’t traditional ads—they’re conversation starters. When you let people see the brains and energy behind your work, you stop looking like just another bidder and start looking like a partner worth watching.</p>

    <h3>Show Your Values in Action</h3>
    <p>Pull marketing is an opportunity to express more than just technical skill. It lets you show what your team cares about—whether that’s sustainability, community impact, innovation, or design thinking. Rather than listing values in a slide deck, you bring them to life through content, events, and visuals that reflect those priorities. It’s the difference between saying “we’re collaborative” and showing a real example of how your team co-created something with a client. These moments build brand character, not just brand recognition.</p>
