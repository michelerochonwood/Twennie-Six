        <b>Leadership isn’t just about delegation — it’s about growth. </b>Becoming a Twennie group leader gives you a rare opportunity to guide others while developing yourself. It’s a real-world proving ground for anyone who wants to explore team engagement, refine their leadership style, and gain experience as a mentor.
      </p>
      <p class="value-fullgroup-paragraph">
        As a leader, you’ll help your team build momentum in their learning and create a collaborative learning culture. You’ll see how people grow when they're encouraged, challenged, and supported — and you’ll grow too. Whether you're already in a leadership role or preparing to step into one, leading a Twennie group gives you a platform to model professionalism, deepen your influence, and make a measurable impact.
