          A micro-study is research conducted by a Twennie member or members related to Twennie topics. It could be an engagement study, a set of client interviews, or a productivity study.
          Below are a few Twennie presently has underway. You can be a part of these studies! Reach out to Twennie to express your interest.
        </p>

          Members can also design their own studies. A micro-study includes a hypothesis, a set of tests or applied stimuli, and a report on observations and conclusions.

          <strong>say for instance...</strong><br><br>
          You want to know what promotes cross-selling across departments in your organization, so you conduct a cross-selling micro-study. You create 60 prompts (3 sets of 20) for cross-selling and challenge your team to complete them over the next six months.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="promo-microstudy-grid-item">
        <p class="promo-microstudy-text">
        <strong>how to do it...</strong><br><br>
          The prompts contain ideas for promoting cross-selling within their organization, giving your team the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of different activities. You supplement the prompt sets with some interviews with senior professionals on the subject, both before and after the prompt set activities.
        </p>

      <div class="promo-microstudy-grid-item">

        <strong>results and data...</strong><br><br>
          Once all the prompts have been completed, Twennie provides a report on completed prompts and member notes. The team leader can now identify which prompts were more successful, allowing refinement of the prompt sets. Now, you have a data-driven approach to improving cross-selling!
