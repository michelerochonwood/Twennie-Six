        <p class="promo-peercoaching-intro">
          Peer coaching is a collaborative process where working people support one another in developing skills, solving challenges, and achieving professional growth. Unlike traditional top-down coaching, peer coaching fosters a reciprocal relationship in which employees at similar levels provide constructive feedback, share experiences, and encourage accountability.
        </p>

        <p class="promo-peercoaching-intro2" style="color:#4a4ab2; font-weight: 800;">
          In the coming year, Twennie plans to pair members for peer coaching. Together, peer coaches can review learning materials and compare notes, especially on prompts and exercises, which involve more collaborative learning.
